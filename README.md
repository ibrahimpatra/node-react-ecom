# Project Setup Instructions

To get this project up and running locally, follow the steps below. The setup process involves installing dependencies for both the backend and frontend, and then starting the respective servers.

---

## 1. **Backend Setup**

### Step 1: Navigate to the Backend Folder
Open your terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all necessary packages as defined in `package.json`.

### Step 3: Start the Backend Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the backend server using `nodemon`:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

This will start the backend server and automatically restart it whenever you make changes to the files.

---

## 2. **Frontend Setup**

### Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Folder
In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary frontend dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all frontend packages defined in `package.json`.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the frontend server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the frontend application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

---

## 3. **Access the Application**

- The backend server should now be running on the port defined in `index.js` (usually `http://localhost:3000).
- The frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3000` or another port depending on your configuration.

You can now interact with the full application by visiting the frontend in your browser.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors during installation or while starting the servers, try the following:
  1. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed correctly. You can verify this by running:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
  2. If there are issues with missing packages, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.

---

## Dependencies

- **Backend**: Uses Node.js, Express, and any other necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
- **Frontend**: Uses React (or any other frontend framework), with dependencies defined in `package.json`.
